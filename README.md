# Seattle Neighborhood Restaurant Finder

### Project Description and Goal

The **Neighborhood Restaurant Finder** is an interactive web map designed to help users explore and discover restaurants in various neighborhoods. The application provides a user-friendly interface to visualize restaurant locations, filter by cuisine type, and view price ranges. Leveraging geospatial data and modern web mapping technologies, the project delivers an engaging and informative experience.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive tool for users to explore dining options in their neighborhood or any area of interest within Seattle. By integrating various data sources and interactive features, the application aims to enhance the user's ability to make informed dining decisions based on location, cuisine, and price. This tool not only aids in decision-making for diners but also serves as a strategic resource for business owners looking to establish new restaurants in optimal locations.

### Website Description

The website is designed to categorize different types of restaurants and their cuisine types in Seattle, while also visualizing regions of high and low competition. Users can filter restaurants by cuisine, price range, and popularity. Using spatial analysis, the website highlights dense restaurant clusters and underserved areas. This functionality helps business owners identify optimal locations for new restaurants and provides diners with insights into food hotspots and transit times to reach them.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience includes:

- **Restaurant Owners**: Individuals looking to open new locations can use the website to visualize areas of lower and higher competition. This enables them to strategize about where their restaurant would be most successful and face the least competition.

- **Potential Consumers**: Both tourists and locals can benefit from the website. Tourists can find the highest-rated restaurants to ensure a pleasant dining experience, while locals can discover new dining spots they havenâ€™t visited before.

## Data Sources
- **Neighborhood Data**: `neighUpdated.geojson`
- **Restaurant Price Data**: `rest_price_updated.geojson`
- **Seattle Restaurants Data**: `seattle_restaurants_final.geojson`


## Applied Libraries and Web Services
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For rendering interactive maps.
- **GitHub**: For version control and repository hosting.
- **Basemap**: For providing the base layer of the map.
- **Shapely**: For spatial operations and filtering restaurants within Seattle boundaries.
- **Yelp Fusion API**: For fetching restaurant data.

## Data Cleaning Process
For our project, we used data from the **Yelp Fusion API**, which provides detailed information about restaurants, including latitude, longitude, address, hours, price, and more. Using the API, we created a GeoJSON file of all restaurants in Seattle using a Python script. We selected key attributes for each restaurant, such as name, rating, cuisine type, address, review count, price, phone number, and Yelp URL.

### Step 1: Fetching Data from Yelp Fusion API
We used a Python script (`import_req.py`) to fetch restaurant data from the Yelp Fusion API. The script iterates through predefined categories (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Korean) and price levels (e.g., $ to $$$$) to collect restaurant data. The data is then saved in a GeoJSON format (`seattle_restaurants_filtered.geojson`).

```python
# Example of fetching data from Yelp Fusion API
import requests
import json
import time

API_KEY = "your_yelp_api_key"
YELP_API_URL = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

def fetch_restaurants(category=None, price=None):
    # Fetch restaurants using filters (category, price) and paginate results
    ...
```

### Step 2: Filtering Restaurants Within Seattle

The Yelp API sometimes returns restaurants outside Seattle (e.g., Bellevue or Mercer Island) due to its search algorithm. To ensure we only included restaurants within Seattle, we used a Python script (`filter_within_seattle.py`) with the `shapely` library to filter restaurants based on the `seattle_boundary.geojson` file. This script checks if each restaurant's coordinates fall within Seattle's boundaries and saves the filtered data to `seattle_restaurants_final.geojson`.

```python
# Example of filtering restaurants within Seattle
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Point
import json

seattle_boundary = gpd.read_file("seattle_boundary.geojson")

with open("seattle_restaurants_filtered.geojson", "r") as f:
    yelp_data = json.load(f)

filtered_restaurants = []

for feature in yelp_data["features"]:
    lon, lat = feature["geometry"]["coordinates"]
    point = Point(lon, lat)
    if seattle_boundary.contains(point).bool():
        filtered_restaurants.append(feature)

output_data = {"type": "FeatureCollection", "features": filtered_restaurants}
with open("seattle_restaurants_final.geojson", "w") as f:
    json.dump(output_data, f, indent=4)

```
### Step 3: Neighborhood Classification
We divided Seattle into neighborhoods using the Seattle Open Data Neighborhood Atlas. The neighborhood map and restaurant data were combined to create the final dataset used in the application.
